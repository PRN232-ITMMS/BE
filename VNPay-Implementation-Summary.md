- ✅ Implemented repositories with comprehensive payment management
- ✅ Updated `UnitOfWork` to include new repositories

### 5. **API Layer**
- ✅ Created comprehensive `PaymentsController` with all required endpoints
- ✅ Proper error handling, logging, and security measures

### 6. **Configuration**
- ✅ Updated `appsettings.json` with your actual VNPay credentials:
  - **TmnCode**: `H9HN7C0Y`
  - **HashSecret**: `A9I18IF9TUK1TPIQAHVSFGFHCU3V8PJV`
  - **PaymentUrl**: Sandbox environment ready for testing
- ✅ Configured dependency injection and service registration

## 🚀 **Ready to Test!**

### Your VNPay Integration is Complete and Ready:
1. **Start the application**: `dotnet run --project InfertilityTreatment.API`
2. **Use the test file**: `vnpay-test.http` for endpoint testing
3. **Test payment flow**: Create payment → Get VNPay URL → Process payment → Handle callback

## 🎯 **Test Credentials Ready**
- Your sandbox credentials are configured and ready
- Use VNPay test card numbers for sandbox testing
- All security measures implemented (HMAC-SHA512 signatures)

## 📋 **Available Endpoints**
- `POST /api/payments/create` - Create VNPay payment
- `POST /api/payments/vnpay/callback` - Handle VNPay IPN  
- `GET /api/payments/history/{customerId}` - Payment history
- `GET /api/payments/status/{paymentId}` - Payment status
- `POST /api/payments/refund` - Process refund (Admin only)
- `GET /api/payments/vnpay/return` - Validate return URL

**🎉 Your VNPay integration is complete and ready for testing!**

### 2. Entity & DTOs
- ✅ Created payment-related DTOs:
  - `PaymentHistoryDto`
  - `PaymentStatusDto` 
  - `RefundRequestDto`
  - `RefundResponseDto`
- ✅ Updated existing DTOs for VNPay integration
- ✅ Created `PaymentGatewayConfig` for configuration

### 3. Business Logic
- ✅ **VNPayHelper** utility class:
  - Payment URL generation with proper HMAC-SHA512 hashing
  - Signature validation for callbacks
  - Amount formatting and parsing
  - Date parsing utilities

- ✅ **PaymentService** implementation:
  - `CreateVNPayPaymentAsync()` - Create payment and generate VNPay URL
  - `HandleVNPayCallbackAsync()` - Process VNPay webhooks securely
  - `GetPaymentHistoryAsync()` - Paginated payment history
  - `GetPaymentStatusAsync()` - Get payment status by ID
  - `ProcessRefundAsync()` - Admin refund processing
  - `ValidateVNPaySignature()` - Signature verification

### 4. Data Access Layer
- ✅ Created `IPaymentRepository` and `IPaymentLogRepository` interfaces
- ✅ Implemented repository classes with Entity Framework
- ✅ Updated `UnitOfWork` to include payment repositories

### 5. API Layer
- ✅ **PaymentsController** with endpoints:
  - `POST /api/payments/create` - Create VNPay payment
  - `POST /api/payments/vnpay/callback` - Handle VNPay webhook
  - `GET /api/payments/history/{customerId}` - Get payment history
  - `GET /api/payments/status/{paymentId}` - Get payment status
  - `POST /api/payments/refund` - Process refund (Admin only)
  - `GET /api/payments/vnpay/return` - Validate return URL

### 6. Configuration
- ✅ Added VNPay configuration to `appsettings.json`
- ✅ Configured dependency injection for payment services
- ✅ Added payment gateway configuration binding

### 7. Security Features
- ✅ HMAC-SHA512 signature validation for all VNPay communications
- ✅ Payment amount tampering prevention
- ✅ Secure callback URL validation
- ✅ Request signing and verification
- ✅ Admin-only refund endpoints with role authorization

## 🔧 VNPay Integration Features

### Payment Flow
1. **Create Payment**: Generate unique payment ID and VNPay URL
2. **Redirect User**: User redirects to VNPay for payment
3. **Callback Processing**: VNPay sends webhook to update payment status
4. **Return URL**: User returns to frontend with payment result
5. **Audit Trail**: All actions logged in PaymentLogs table

### Security Measures
- Signature validation using HMAC-SHA512
- Payment URL parameter validation
- Duplicate transaction prevention
- Secure callback handling
- Amount tampering protection

## 📝 Testing

### Test File Created: `test-vnpay-integration.http`
- Payment creation tests
- Callback simulation
- Payment status checks
- Refund processing
- Return URL validation

## 🛠 Configuration Required

### Update `appsettings.json` with real VNPay credentials:
```json
{
  "PaymentGateways": {
    "VNPay": {
      "TmnCode": "YOUR_VNPAY_TMN_CODE",
      "HashSecret": "YOUR_VNPAY_HASH_SECRET",
      "PaymentUrl": "https://sandbox.vnpayment.vn/paymentv2/vpcpay.html",
      "CallbackUrl": "https://yourdomain.com/api/payments/vnpay/callback",
      "ReturnUrl": "https://yourfrontend.com/payment/result"
    }
  }
}
```

## ✅ Definition of Done Status

- ✅ Payment callbacks handled securely with signature validation
- ✅ Payment history tracking accurate with pagination
- ✅ Refund processing implemented for admins
- ✅ Security measures in place (HMAC validation, tampering prevention)
- ✅ Audit trail with PaymentLogs for all payment actions
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging

## 🚀 Ready for Testing

The VNPay integration is now complete and ready for testing with:
1. VNPay sandbox credentials
2. Frontend integration
3. Webhook endpoint configuration
4. SSL certificate for production callbacks

## 📖 Next Steps
